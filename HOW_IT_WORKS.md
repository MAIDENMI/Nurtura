# How the Infant Breathing & Heart Rate Monitor Works

## üéØ Overview

This AI-powered monitor uses **computer vision** and **signal processing** to detect breathing and heart rate through a regular camera - no sensors, wearables, or physical contact needed. It's like having a medical monitoring device, but it works through video alone.

## üí® How Breathing Detection Works

### The Science

When you breathe, your chest and abdomen move up and down. These tiny movements cause subtle changes in the pixels of a video feed. Our system detects these micro-movements using three advanced techniques:

### 1. **Multi-Point Body Tracking**
- Uses Google's MediaPipe AI to identify and track **33 body landmarks** in real-time
- Focuses on three key regions:
  - **Chest**: Primary breathing indicator (shoulder/ribcage area)
  - **Abdomen**: Secondary breathing indicator (diaphragm area)
  - **Nose**: Detects airflow-related micro-movements
  - **Control Point**: Tracks static areas to filter out non-breathing motion (camera shake, body sway)

### 2. **Color Change Analysis** (Research-Validated)
- Every breath causes tiny blood flow changes under the skin
- These create subtle color shifts invisible to the human eye but detectable by cameras
- We analyze the **Blue, Green, and Red (BGR) color channels** from each tracking region
- Method based on published research: [Respiratory Rate from Photoplethysmography](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/aa670e)

### 3. **Advanced Signal Processing**
Our system processes the raw color signals through multiple stages:

```
Raw Video ‚Üí Body Tracking ‚Üí Color Extraction ‚Üí Filtering ‚Üí Peak Detection ‚Üí Breathing Rate
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Extract signals**: Capture BGR color values from chest, abdomen, and nose regions (50x50 pixel blocks)
2. **Filter noise**: Apply bandpass filter (0.1-1.0 Hz = 6-60 breaths/min) to remove non-breathing signals
3. **Detect peaks**: Identify breath cycles using statistical peak detection
4. **Calculate rate**: Count peaks over 5 seconds, convert to breaths per minute (BPM)
5. **Combine sources**: Merge chest, abdomen, and nose measurements with confidence weighting
6. **Smooth output**: Apply adaptive smoothing based on signal quality

### Age-Adaptive Detection

The system automatically adjusts sensitivity based on detected age:

| Age Category | Sensitivity | Normal Range | Why Different? |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Infant (0-2yr)** | Very High (10%) | 30-60 BPM | Shallower breathing, smaller movements |
| **Child (3-12yr)** | High (15%) | 20-40 BPM | Moderate breathing depth |
| **Adult (13+yr)** | Normal (20%) | 12-25 BPM | Deeper, more visible breathing |

## ‚ù§Ô∏è How Heart Rate Detection Works

### The Science: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG)

Every heartbeat pumps blood through your face and body. This causes **microscopic color changes** in your skin that are invisible to the naked eye but detectable by high-quality cameras.

### Method (Based on Published Research)

Our heart rate detection is based on:
- **van der Kooij & Naber (2019)**: [Remote heart rate measurement from face videos under realistic situations](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-019-01256-8)
- **van der Kooij & Naber (2019)**: [An open-source remote heart rate imaging method](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797647/)

**How it works:**

1. **Focus on the nose region**
   - High blood vessel density
   - Good visibility in most camera angles
   - Less affected by facial expressions

2. **Extract the Green channel**
   - Green light (500-600 nm wavelength) is most absorbed by oxygenated hemoglobin
   - Provides the strongest cardiac pulse signal
   - More sensitive to blood volume changes than red or blue

3. **Filter for cardiac frequencies**
   - Bandpass filter: 0.7-4.0 Hz (42-240 BPM)
   - Removes breathing artifacts and noise
   - Isolates the cardiac pulse wave

4. **Detect heartbeats**
   - Statistical peak detection identifies each heartbeat
   - Calculate intervals between peaks
   - Convert to beats per minute (BPM)

5. **Validate quality**
   - Check peak regularity (healthy hearts beat rhythmically)
   - Verify signal strength
   - Assign confidence score (0-100%)

### Visual Analogy

Think of it like this:
- **Breathing detection**: Watching a balloon inflate and deflate
- **Heart rate detection**: Seeing ripples in water from raindrops - each "ripple" is a heartbeat traveling through blood vessels

## ü§ù Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Is this safe for infants?**  
A: Yes, it's completely non-contact and passive - just a camera watching. No radiation, sensors, or physical contact.

**Q: Can it replace my baby monitor?**  
A: It can supplement one, but don't rely on it exclusively for safety-critical monitoring.

**Q: How accurate is it really?**  
A: In good conditions: ¬±2-5 BPM for breathing, ¬±3-8 BPM for heart rate. Medical devices are ¬±1-2 BPM.

**Q: Will it work in the dark?**  
A: No, it needs visible light. Infrared night vision won't work as it needs color information.

**Q: Can it detect sleep apnea?**  
A: It can detect when breathing stops, but it's not validated for medical diagnosis. See a doctor for sleep apnea concerns.
