# Enhanced Body Tracking & Detection

## ðŸŽ¯ Major Improvements

Your breathing and heart rate monitor now has **MAXIMUM ACCURACY** body tracking!

### What's Been Enhanced

## 1. **MediaPipe Pose - UPGRADED to Highest Accuracy**

**Before:**
```python
model_complexity=0  # Lite model (fast but less accurate)
min_detection_confidence=0.5  # Lower threshold
```

**After:**
```python
model_complexity=2  # HEAVY MODEL - Maximum accuracy!
min_detection_confidence=0.7  # Higher quality detections only
min_tracking_confidence=0.7  # Better frame-to-frame tracking
smooth_landmarks=True  # Smoother, more natural movement
enable_segmentation=True  # Person isolation from background
```

### Result:
- ðŸŽ¯ **More accurate landmark detection** (33 body points)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Better tracking during movement**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Smoother, less jittery**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Works better with partial occlusion**

---

## 2. **Enhanced Chest Detection**

**Before:** Simple midpoint between shoulders
```python
chest = (left_shoulder + right_shoulder) / 2
```

**After:** Multi-landmark weighted average
```python
# Uses shoulders (60%) + hips (40%) for optimal chest center
# This is where maximum respiratory expansion occurs
chest_x = (shoulder_mid * 0.5 + hip_mid * 0.5)
chest_y = (shoulder_mid * 0.6 + hip_mid * 0.4)

# Also considers elbows for additional stability
```

### Result:
- âœ… **Tracks actual center of torso mass**
- âœ… **Captures maximum breathing movement**
- âœ… **More stable during arm movement**
- âœ… **Better for different body positions** (sitting, lying down)

---

## 3. **Enhanced Abdomen Detection**

**Before:** Simple hip midpoint
```python
abdomen = (left_hip + right_hip) / 2
```

**After:** Diaphragm-targeted positioning
```python
# 30% shoulders + 70% hips = diaphragm area
# Perfect for abdominal/diaphragmatic breathing
abdomen_x = (shoulder_mid * 0.3 + hip_mid * 0.7)
abdomen_y = (shoulder_mid * 0.3 + hip_mid * 0.7)
```

### Result:
- âœ… **Targets diaphragm movement specifically**
- âœ… **Better captures abdominal breathing**
- âœ… **Optimal for infants** (who breathe more abdominally)

---

## 4. **Enhanced Nose/Face Tracking**

**Before:** Just nose landmark
```python
nose_x = nose.x
nose_y = nose.y
```

**After:** Nose with intelligent fallback
```python
if nose.visibility > 0.5:
    # Use nose if clearly visible
    nose_point = nose_position
else:
    # Fallback to mouth center if nose obscured
    nose_point = (mouth_left + mouth_right) / 2 - offset
```

### Result:
- âœ… **More reliable heart rate detection**
- âœ… **Works even if nose partially hidden**
- âœ… **Automatic fallback mechanism**
- âœ… **Better for different head angles**

---

## 5. **Adaptive Block Sizing** ðŸ†•

**Before:** Fixed 20-40 pixel blocks for everyone

**After:** Intelligent sizing based on body size
```python
# Calculate person size from landmarks
torso_height = shoulder_to_hip_distance
shoulder_width = left_to_right_shoulder_distance

# Adaptive block: 30-80 pixels based on actual body size
adaptive_block = body_size * 0.25
# Larger people = larger blocks
# Smaller people/infants = smaller blocks
```

### Result:
- âœ… **Automatically adjusts for adults vs infants**
- âœ… **Captures correct amount of skin area**
- âœ… **Better signal quality for all body sizes**
- âœ… **No manual calibration needed**

---

## 6. **Signal Quality Enhancement**

**Before:** Simple mean of pixels
```python
signal = np.mean(region)
```

**After:** Robust statistical approach
```python
# Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
region_smoothed = cv2.GaussianBlur(region, (5, 5), 0)

# Use MEDIAN instead of MEAN
# (Less affected by bright spots, shadows, outliers)
signal = np.median(region_smoothed)

# Calculate quality metrics
quality = signal_standard_deviation
```

### Result:
- âœ… **Cleaner heart rate signal (rPPG)**
- âœ… **Less affected by lighting variations**
- âœ… **More robust to camera noise**
- âœ… **Better in suboptimal conditions**

---

## 7. **Visibility & Confidence Tracking** ðŸ†•

**New Feature:** Each tracking point now has a quality score!

```python
landmark_quality = {
    'chest': 0.95,    # 95% confident
    'abdomen': 0.87,  # 87% confident
    'nose': 0.92,     # 92% confident (great for HR!)
    'control': 1.00   # Always 100%
}
```

### Shows on screen:
```
CHEST (95%)
ABDOMEN (87%)
NOSE (92%)
```

### Result:
- âœ… **Know when tracking is reliable**
- âœ… **Automatic quality weighting**
- âœ… **Better confidence scores**
- âœ… **Debug visibility issues**

---

## 8. **Enhanced Visualization** ðŸŽ¨

**Before:** Simple circles

**After:** Full pose skeleton + detailed tracking boxes

```
âœ… Full body skeleton (33 landmarks connected)
âœ… Colored tracking boxes (shows capture areas)
âœ… Quality percentages on each point
âœ… Semi-transparent labels
âœ… White-outlined center points
```

### Colors:
- ðŸ”´ **RED BOX** = Chest (torso breathing)
- ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN BOX** = Abdomen (diaphragm)
- ðŸ”µ **CYAN BOX** = Nose (heart rate via rPPG)
- âšª **GRAY BOX** = Control (background reference)

## Best Practices

### For Maximum Accuracy:

1. **Lighting**
   - Good ambient lighting
   - Avoid harsh shadows
   - Consistent lighting (not flickering)

2. **Camera Position**
   - Face camera directly (for heart rate)
   - Full torso visible (for breathing)
   - 3-6 feet distance optimal

3. **Subject Position**
   - Sitting upright or lying flat works best
   - Avoid extreme angles
   - Keep torso mostly visible

4. **Clothing**
   - Lighter colors better for infants
   - Avoid very loose/baggy clothing
   - Face should be unobstructed

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Accuracy Is Still Low:

1. **Check Landmark Quality percentages**
   - Should be >60% for good results
   - <50% means poor visibility

2. **Improve Lighting**
   - Add more ambient light
   - Reduce shadows
   - Avoid backlighting

3. **Adjust Camera**
   - Move closer/farther
   - Change angle
   - Ensure full body in frame

4. **Reduce Motion**
   - Keep subject relatively still
   - Reduce camera shake
   - Use stable mount
