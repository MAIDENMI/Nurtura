# Project Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Created

Your **Infant Breathing Monitor AI** system is complete! Here's what you have:

### üéØ Three Versions

1. **Basic** (`breathing_monitor.py`)
   - Standalone, easy to understand
   - Core breathing detection functionality
   - Perfect for learning the basics

2. **Graphical** (`breathing_monitor_graphical.py`) ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED!**
   - **Real-time graphs like a heart rate monitor**
   - Breathing rate graph with color-coded zones
   - Motion waveform showing each breath
   - Dual window display
   - Perfect for demonstrations

3. **Advanced** (`breathing_monitor_advanced.py`)
   - Configuration file support
   - Data logging to CSV
   - Alert system
   - FPS display
   - Best for research/production

### üìä The Graphical Version Features

Note: You asked about showing "heart rate" graphs - this actually monitors **breathing rate**, but displays it just like a heart rate monitor!

**What you'll see:**
- **Top Graph**: Breathing rate over time (breaths/min)
  - Green zone: 20-60 BPM (normal)
  - Red zones: Abnormal rates
  
- **Bottom Graph**: Motion waveform
  - Shows each individual breath
  - Like an ECG/EKG display
  - Each peak = one breath cycle

### üõ†Ô∏è Easy-to-Use Scripts

- `./run.sh graph` - Run with graphs (macOS/Linux)
- `run.bat graph` - Run with graphs (Windows)
- `./setup_py311.sh` - One-command setup

### üìö Comprehensive Documentation

- `README.md` - Full documentation
- `QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute getting started
- `GRAPHICAL_VERSION.md` - Graphical version guide
- `VISUAL_EXAMPLE.txt` - ASCII art of what you'll see
- `MACOS_CAMERA_PERMISSIONS.md` - Camera access fix
- `INSTALL.md` - Detailed installation
- `PYTHON_VERSION_FIX.md` - Python version issues

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Grant camera permissions first
#    System Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Enable Terminal

# 2. Restart Terminal (Cmd+Q then reopen)

# 3. Run the graphical version
cd /Users/aidenm/Testch
./run.sh graph
```

## üé® What Makes It Special

1. **Automatic Torso Detection**
   - Uses MediaPipe AI to find infant's chest automatically
   - No manual ROI selection needed

2. **Optical Flow Analysis**
   - Measures subtle breathing movements
   - Works even with minimal motion

3. **Real-Time Graphs** (Graphical Version)
   - See breathing patterns instantly
   - Visual feedback like medical monitors
   - Color-coded alerts

4. **Raspberry Pi Optimized**
   - Lightweight model (complexity=0)
   - Configurable performance settings
   - Works on low-power devices

## üìù Technical Stack

- **Python 3.11** (required for MediaPipe)
- **OpenCV** - Video capture and optical flow
- **MediaPipe** - Pose detection AI
- **NumPy** - Numerical processing
- **Matplotlib** - Real-time graphing (graphical version)

## üîß Current Status

‚úÖ **Installed**:
- Python 3.11.14
- All dependencies in isolated venv
- Matplotlib 3.10.7 (for graphs)

‚ùó **Needs Camera Permission**:
- macOS blocks camera access by default
- See `MACOS_CAMERA_PERMISSIONS.md` for fix

## üìä Graphical Display (Your Request!)

You wanted visual graphs - here's what each shows:

### Breathing Rate Graph (Top)
```
Shows: Calculated breaths per minute
Updates: Continuously in real-time
Range: 0-80 BPM (auto-scales)
Zones: Green (normal), Red (abnormal)
Purpose: Overall breathing rate trend
```

### Motion Waveform (Bottom)
```
Shows: Raw breathing motion signal
Updates: Live feed of chest movement
Pattern: Peaks = inhale, valleys = exhale
Purpose: See individual breaths as they happen
Similar to: Heart rate monitor's ECG display
```

### Together:
- Bottom graph = Individual breaths (real-time)
- Top graph = Calculated rate (averaged)
- **Just like medical monitors that show both heart waveform and BPM!**

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Educational**
   - Learn about breathing detection
   - Computer vision demonstration
   - AI/ML project showcase

2. **Research**
   - Breathing pattern analysis
   - Motion detection studies
   - Non-contact monitoring research

3. **Demonstration**
   - The graphical version looks impressive!
   - Great for presentations
   - Visual feedback for understanding

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **NOT a Medical Device**
   - Educational/research purposes only
   - Don't use for actual infant monitoring
   - Always consult healthcare professionals

2. **Breathing vs Heart Rate**
   - This measures **breathing** (respiratory rate)
   - NOT heart rate (pulse)
   - Display style similar to heart monitors

3. **Camera Access Required**
   - Must grant permissions on macOS
   - Restart Terminal after granting
   - See camera permissions guide

## üéâ You're Ready!

Everything is set up. Once you grant camera permissions:

```bash
./run.sh graph
```

You'll see:
1. Camera feed with torso detection
2. **Real-time breathing rate graph**
3. **Live motion waveform (like a heart monitor!)**
4. Color-coded status

Press 's' to screenshot both windows!
