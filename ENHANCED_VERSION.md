## 🎯 Research-Inspired Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Optical Flow** 🌊

**What the research found:**
- Dense optical flow outperforms sparse methods for respiration
- Specific parameters matter for infant breathing detection
- Vertical flow component is most reliable

**What we implemented:**
```python
# Optimized parameters based on research
flow = cv2.calcOpticalFlowFarneback(
    pyr_scale=0.5,      # Pyramid scale
    levels=3,            # Pyramid levels
    winsize=15,          # Window size
    iterations=3,        # Iterations
    poly_n=7,           # Neighborhood (increased from 5)
    poly_sigma=1.5,     # Smoothing (increased from 1.2)
)

# Focus on vertical flow (breathing is primarily up/down)
vertical_flow = flow[:, :, 1]
```

### 2. **Better ROI Selection** 🎯

**What the research found:**
- Upper chest shows strongest respiration signal
- ROI should focus on chest, not full torso
- Adaptive sizing improves tracking

**What we implemented:**
```python
# Focus on upper 60% of torso (chest area)
chest_focus = shoulder_y + 0.6 * (hip_y - shoulder_y)

# Adaptive padding based on torso size
padding_x = int(torso_width * 0.15)
padding_y = int((y_max - y_min) * 0.1)
```

**Visual comparison:**
```
Original:                    Enhanced:
┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐
│  Shoulder   │             │  Shoulder   │ ← Focus here
│             │             ├─────────────┤
│   Chest     │             │ **CHEST**   │ ← Primary ROI
│             │             │ **AREA**    │ ← Best signal
│    Hip      │             └─────────────┘
└─────────────┘             (Hip excluded)
```

### 3. **Signal Processing** 📊

**What the research found:**
- Bandpass filtering improves accuracy
- Peak detection needs constraints
- Signal regularity indicates confidence

**What we implemented:**
```python
# Bandpass filter for breathing frequencies
# Infant range: 20-60 BPM = 0.33-1.0 Hz
b, a = signal.butter(3, [0.2, 1.2], btype='band')
filtered_signal = signal.filtfilt(b, a, motion_array)

# Advanced peak detection with constraints
peaks, properties = signal.find_peaks(
    smoothed_signal,
    height=threshold,           # Adaptive threshold
    distance=min_peak_distance, # Min 0.8 seconds
    prominence=threshold * 0.3  # Peak prominence
)
```

### 4. **Confidence Scoring** 💯

**What the research found:**
- Not all measurements are equally reliable
- Regularity of breathing indicates confidence
- Should communicate uncertainty to users

**What we implemented:**
```python
# Confidence based on breathing regularity
interval_std = np.std(peak_intervals)
interval_mean = np.mean(peak_intervals)
confidence = max(0, 1 - (interval_std / interval_mean))

# Visual feedback:
# Green box + high confidence = reliable
# Orange/Red box + low confidence = uncertain
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Key Algorithms

**1. Dense Optical Flow**
- Farneback method with optimized parameters
- Focuses on vertical displacement
- Smoothed with Gaussian filtering

**2. Signal Processing Pipeline**
```
Raw Motion → Detrending → Bandpass Filter → 
Smoothing → Peak Detection → Rate Calculation → 
Confidence Scoring
```

**3. Adaptive Thresholding**
```python
threshold = mean(signal) + 0.5 * std(signal)
```

**4. Frequency Analysis**
- Analyzes signal in 0.2-1.2 Hz range
- Matches infant breathing frequencies
- Rejects out-of-band noise

### Research Validation

The AIRFlowNet paper showed:
- **MAE**: 2-4 breaths/min on AIR-125 dataset
- **Correlation**: 0.85-0.95 with ground truth
- **Better than** DeepPhys, EfficientPhys, TS-CAN

Our implementation uses their optical flow approach (the foundation of their deep learning model) with enhanced signal processing.
