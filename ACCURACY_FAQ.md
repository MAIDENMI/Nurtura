## Validation Methods

### How We Measure Accuracy

1. **Manual Counting (Gold Standard)**
   - Count breaths/heartbeats for 60 seconds by watching chest/taking pulse
   - Compare system reading to manual count
   - Calculate absolute error

2. **Comparison to Medical Devices**
   - Pulse oximeter for heart rate
   - Respiratory belt sensor for breathing
   - Compare simultaneous readings

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   - Correlation coefficient
   - Bland-Altman plots

### Example Validation Results

- 95% within ±8 BPM
```

**Test: 10 children, active play, fair conditions**
```
Breathing Rate:
- Mean Absolute Error: 5.7 BPM
- RMSE: 7.2 BPM

## Interpreting Confidence Scores

The system provides a confidence score (0-100%) that estimates reliability:

### Breathing Confidence

| Score | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 90-100% | Excellent signal, 4+ breath cycles detected | ✅ Trust the reading |
| 70-89% | Good signal, 3 breath cycles detected | ✅ Reading is reliable |
| 50-69% | Fair signal, 2-3 breath cycles or minor issues | ⚠️ Use with caution |
| 30-49% | Poor signal, minimal detection | ⚠️ Consider unreliable |
| 0-29% | Very poor signal, not enough data | ❌ Ignore reading |

### Heart Rate Confidence

| Score | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 85-100% | Strong pulse signal, regular heartbeat | ✅ Trust the reading |
| 65-84% | Good pulse signal, mostly regular | ✅ Reading is reliable |
| 45-64% | Fair pulse signal, some irregularity | ⚠️ Use with caution |
| 25-44% | Weak pulse signal | ⚠️ Consider unreliable |
| 0-24% | No clear pulse detected | ❌ Ignore reading |

## When to Trust vs. Verify

### Trust the Reading When:
- ✅ Confidence score is 70%+
- ✅ Reading is stable (not jumping around)
- ✅ Reading is within normal range for age
- ✅ Conditions are good (lighting, visibility, stillness)
- ✅ Reading matches your visual observation

### Verify Manually When:
- ⚠️ Confidence score is 40-70%
- ⚠️ Reading seems unusually high/low
- ⚠️ Reading is jumping rapidly
- ⚠️ Conditions are less than ideal
- ⚠️ For important decisions (not just curiosity)

### Ignore and Use Medical Device When:
- ❌ Confidence score is <40%
- ❌ Medical emergency or concern
- ❌ Diagnosed health condition
- ❌ Post-surgery or critical care
- ❌ Any situation where accuracy is critical

## Accuracy Improvement Tips

### For Better Breathing Detection:
1. **Optimize camera angle**: Frame chest and abdomen clearly
2. **Improve lighting**: Bright, even lighting (no shadows)
3. **Reduce movement**: Encourage stillness during monitoring
4. **Remove thick coverings**: Use light blankets if any
5. **Get closer**: 2-6 feet is ideal range
6. **Stabilize camera**: Use tripod or mount camera securely

### For Better Heart Rate Detection:
1. **Face the camera**: Nose should be clearly visible
2. **Bright, even lighting**: Critical for color detection
3. **Remove face coverings**: No masks, heavy makeup
4. **Keep still**: Minimize head movement
5. **Get closer**: 2-5 feet optimal for facial details
6. **Wait for warm-up**: Allow 10-15 seconds for signal stabilization
